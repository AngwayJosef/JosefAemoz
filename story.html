						<h1>About the Author</h1>
						<p>
							Leo Tolstoy (born August 28 [September 9, New Style], 1828, Yasnaya Polyana, Tula province, Russian Empire—died November 7 [November 20], 1910, Astapovo, Ryazan province) was a Russian author, a master of realistic fiction and one of the world’s greatest novelists.
						</p><p><br>
							Tolstoy is best known for his two longest works, War and Peace (1865–69) and Anna Karenina (1875–77), which are commonly regarded as among the finest novels ever written. War and Peace in particular seems virtually to define this form for many readers and critics. Among Tolstoy’s shorter works, The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) is usually classed among the best examples of the novella. Especially during his last three decades Tolstoy also achieved world renown as a moral and religious teacher. His doctrine of nonresistance to evil had an important influence on Gandhi. Although Tolstoy’s religious ideas no longer command the respect they once did, interest in his life and personality has, if anything, increased over the years.

							Leo Tolstoy’s short story God Sees the Truth, But Waits presents a powerful narrative about justice, forgiveness, and the human struggle against an unjust world. The protagonist, Ivan Dmitrich Aksionov, is falsely accused and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. Despite his innocence, he spends years in prison, suffering the consequences of an unfair justice system. Tolstoy masterfully explores the themes of faith and endurance, showing how Ivan maintains hope in a higher power even when human justice fails him. Through Ivan’s tragic journey, Tolstoy critiques a society where justice can be influenced by social standing, highlighting the harsh reality that life often favors the powerful over the innocent.</p><br>

								<em>Forgiveness and Kindness.</em> Ivan Aksionov has continuously shown throughout the stroy how good a person he is like and has proven that despite knowing that he was wrongly accused, he didn't give rage out and make a scene. Instead, he just accepts the punishment, even enduring the many years of the consequences of other peoeple's actions. Aditionally when Makar was brought to prison, Aksionov has shown him goodness and has shown no intent of antagonizing Makar. <br></p>
							<p class="space1" >
								<em>Paitence.</em> His Devotion in his Faith also highlight how good and patient he can be. Because of his loyalty to serving the Lord, he was stayed sane and no seed of evil sprouted from his heart. Even With the many years that he stayed in prison, he continually prayed without any doubt that he might get free soon. <br></p>
							<p class="space1" >
								<em>Injustice and Unfair Treatment.</em> Even though he was a good person, he was wrongly accused and was framed by the authorities that he was the culprit of murdering someone. The truth is, many people experience the same thing and even more lose their minds because they cannot handle how they were put in such an unfortunate situation. Makar's devious way of putting the bloody knife in Aksionov's bag also highlights how evil preys on kind and pure hearts to escape the consequences of their own actions.

								<em>Life's Cruel Reality.</em> Aksionov's death in the end can symblize many things. However, one thing that stands out the most is how life can either be kind or cruel. In the story's sense, life was kind to him because in his many years in prison, he continued to live and even gained respect from the people in the prison. But at the same time, life was heavily cruel to him because he had to wait decades to be given justice but still dying shortly after.
								<br></p>

							<p class="space1" >
								<em>Happiness is Short Lived</em> Aksionov's death shortly after being served justice illustrates how worldly things are bound to easily end. One can have what they heavily wished for in a long time, losing that shortly after either by the years or just simply dying. Knowing this, there are many things that can be paralled from it, for example, a paycheck, a long awaited vacation, retirement, even relationship. It really is cruel, but earthly things are bount to last. <br></p>

								In God Sees the Truth, But Waits, Tolstoy poignantly illustrates that life is often cruelly unfair, with justice serving the elite while the innocent suffer in silence. Ivan’s story reveals how easily human systems can fail, leaving individuals at the mercy of those in power. Although Ivan ultimately finds inner peace and forgiveness, Tolstoy’s message is clear: true justice may exist only in the eyes of a higher power. The story reminds us that while the world may often neglect the innocent, the truth is never entirely hidden—and, ultimately, everyone will answer for their actions.</p>
